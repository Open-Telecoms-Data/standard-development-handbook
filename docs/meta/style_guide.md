# Style guide

This style guide covers our conventions when writing:

* OCDS Schema and standard documentation
* GitHub issues
* Helpdesk responses
* Associated presentations and documents

## Readability

We strive to write concise, clear documentation. To improve your writing, please learn how to [write for the web](https://www.usa.gov/style-guide/writing-for-web) (with many more resources at [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/topic/writing-web/)), and consider using these tools:

* [Hemingway Editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
* [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
* Readability statistics in Microsoft Word or [online tools](https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/flesch-kincaid.html)

## Spelling

Use American English (e.g. 'organization' rather than 'organisation') unless we are aligning a field name with an existing standard that uses alternative spellings. Notably, this means being careful about using 'z' instead of 's' in many words of Latin origin.

## Text formatting

* When referring to a **field** or **codelist**, use the camelCase version of the field/codelist name, and enclose it in backticks so it is displayed in a montotype font as follows: `camelCase`
* When referring to a **building block**, use the capitalized CamelCase version of the building block name, and enclose it in backticks so it is displayed in a montotype font as follows: `CamelCase`
* When referring to a **code** from a codelist, enclose the value in single quotes, e.g. "We have added a 'direct' code to the `method` codelist"
* When pluralizing a **field** or **building block**, treat the field/building block name as a proper noun, and add a `'s` instead of an `s` to the end, or treat it as a mass noun and add nothing to the end

## Word choice

* 'ocid' not 'OCID'. Although abbreviations in prose are uppercase, the mixing of upper- and lowercase in the documentation (when referring to the concept versus the field) may cause confusion.
* 'codelist' not 'code-list' or 'code list'
* 'changelog' not 'change-log' or 'change log'
* 'data package' not 'datapackage'
* 'metadata' not 'meta-data' or 'meta data'
