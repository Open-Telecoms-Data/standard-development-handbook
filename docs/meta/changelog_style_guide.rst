Changelog style guide
=====================

-  Changelog entries should be descriptive.

   Bad entry
     Update merging specification.
   Good entry
     Add rules on setting ``id`` and ``date`` for compiled releases to the merging specification.

-  To reduce merge conflicts, add new changelog entries to the end of the relevant bullet list.
