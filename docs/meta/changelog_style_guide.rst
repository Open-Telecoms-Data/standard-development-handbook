Changelog style guide
=====================

Normative content
-----------------

-  Changelog entries should be descriptive.

   Bad entry
     Update merging specification.
   Good entry
     Add rules on setting ``id`` and ``date`` for compiled releases to the merging specification.

-  To reduce merge conflicts, add new changelog entries to the end of the relevant bullet list.

Non-normative content
---------------------

Changelog entries should be descriptive. Do not add an entry like "Improve organizational unit example." Instead, simply add the PR number to the "Add worked examples for the Map phase" entry.
