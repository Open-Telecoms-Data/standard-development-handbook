Documentation philosophy
========================

Proximity
---------

Documentation should be maximally proximate to the thing it is documenting. For example, to document what a method in software does, it's best to author that documentation as a heredoc in the method itself, instead of in a separate document.

With respect to OCDS tools, a tool's own readme should document the tool. The handbook should instead focus on (1) grouping and listing tools and (2) describing how they fit together into a workflow or process. Those focuses go beyond the scope of a single tool and therefore belong in a 'meta' location like this handbook.

Exceptionally, for the `standard <https://github.com/open-contracting/standard>`__ repository, since all changes to it require careful review, it's advantageous to move to the handbook all documentation of its technical development and maintenance, so that we can change it more frequently and easily.
