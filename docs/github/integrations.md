### Travis cron jobs

[Travis cron jobs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/) are not presently in use. A job run is the same as a normal run of the tests defined in `.travis.yml`. The job can be enabled or disabled via the Travis settings for the repository. Notifications are [configured in `.travis.yml`](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/#Configuring-email-notifications).
