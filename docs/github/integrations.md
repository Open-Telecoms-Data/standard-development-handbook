### Travis cron jobs

A job run is the same as a normal run defined in `.travis.yml`. The job can be enabled or disabled via the Travis settings for the repository. Notifications are [configured in `.travis.yml`](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/#Configuring-email-notifications).

[Travis cron jobs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/) are used for the daily build of the Extension Explorer.
