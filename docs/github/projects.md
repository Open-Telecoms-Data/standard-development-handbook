# Projects

The [`open-contracting` organization](https://github.com/orgs/open-contracting/projects) has [GitHub Projects](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/), which are used to organize [sprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development)) in a [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) system.

We also have an [agile board](https://crm.open-contracting.org/projects/tech/agile/board) in the CRM. Its uses and features are somewhat distinct (e.g. time tracking) and complementary (e.g. long-term project management) to what GitHub offers.

GitHub Projects allows adding cards that are not attached to issues. People expect to have visibility of all of a repository's issues within the Issues tab, so cards should be used only to organize a sprint, not to document an issue requiring a fix.

Projects have, at minimum, columns for *To do*, *In progress* and *Done*. A card is moved from the *To do* column to the *In progress* column to indicate that the assignee is working on the card. The *Done* column can be [configured](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-automation-for-project-boards/) as follows:

* Click the 'â€¦' button in the column's header
* Click 'Manage automation'
* Select 'Preset: Done' and check the three boxes
* Click 'Update automation'

As such, it should generally not be necessary to move cards into the *Done* column.

Projects should not last forever. Incomplete tasks should be reviewed for inclusion in a future Project, and the Project should be closed.
