# Projects

The [`open-contracting` organization](https://github.com/orgs/open-contracting/projects) uses [GitHub Projects](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) to organize work in a [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) system.

We also have an [agile board](https://crm.open-contracting.org/projects/ocds-team-tools-development-portfolio/agile/board) in the CRM. Its uses and features are distinct (e.g. time tracking) and complementary (e.g. long-term project management) to what GitHub offers.

People expect to have visibility of all of a repository's issues within the *Issues* tab; therefore, a card that is not attached to an issue should never be added to a project.

New projects should be created using the *Automated kanban* template.
