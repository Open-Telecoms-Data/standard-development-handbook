Building the documentation
==========================

See the standardâ€™s page for `Building the documentation <../../../standard/technical/build>`__.

Change version of OCDS
----------------------

1. Change ``standard_tag`` and ``standard_version`` in ``conf.py`` to the desired version of OCDS
2. Update the versions of extensions in ``extension_versions.json``, if appropriate
3. `Rebuild the profile <#build-the-profile>`__

Change extensions
-----------------

To change the extensions in a profile, change ``extension_versions.json``, then `rebuild the profile <#build-the-profile>`__.

Extensions must be in the `extension registry <https://github.com/open-contracting/extension_registry>`__ and should be tagged and released. See `creating new releases of core extensions <../../standard/technical/deployment.html#create-new-versions-of-core-extensions>`__.

Build the profile
-----------------

See the `repository documentation <repository>`__ for information on what files are built by ``build-profile.py``.

.. code:: shell

   make clean_dist
   python schema/build-profile.py
