# Notifications

For CRM-related notifications, see the [CRM's wiki](https://crm.open-contracting.org/projects/ocds/wiki/Alert_settings). Otherwise:

* GitHub issue activity notifies all repository watchers and all issue subscribers. (Same for pull requests.) The GitHub accounts of many Open Data Services developers are configured to automatically watch new repositories.
* GitHub Actions, by default, notifies the committer of the last commit about a build's failure.
* Trello card activity notifies all board watchers and all card watchers.

Emails sent to code@opendataservices.coop are delivered to all Open Data Services developers.
