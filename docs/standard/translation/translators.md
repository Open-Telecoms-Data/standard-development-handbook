# Translators, proofreaders and reviewers

Translators, proofreaders and reviewers have excellent writing skills (spelling and grammar) and intervene only when the target language is their native language.

**Translators** write the source content in one of the target languages. They must be familiar with the topics (public contracting and data) and apply the guidelines (this document) and [terminology](../terminology) (in Transifex) provided by the Open Contracting Partnership.

**Proofreaders** proofread the translation and focus on the quality of the writing: spelling, grammar, punctuation. They normally don't need to look at the source content.

**Reviewers** review the translation to ensure it is functional. A functional translation enables the reader to access the same information and perform the same tasks as the source document would. Reviewers are specialists of the domains at hand (public contracting and data) and focus on the clarity of the phrasing and the good usage of the terminology.

Candidates for these roles are stored in a spreadsheet named "Roles in OCP translation and terminology processes" and in the CRM as contacts tagged "translator".
